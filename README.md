# Transportation-System
Transportation networks - CSSE2002 UQ

This project aims to build a Transportation System that contains the following classes:
Passengers
Routes
Stops
Vehicles

With every entry, the network tries to figure out the most efficient and cheapest route for passenger to reach destination. 
In order to achieve this, the routing tables for each Route object needs to be updated automatically. 

This function was built with high correlation to Dynamic Routing Table for real networks hosts, with similar information fields like
next hop, metric that will be automatically generated. 

The network file is meant to simplify data entry, where a text-based file with correct format can be read and retrieved data into the system.
